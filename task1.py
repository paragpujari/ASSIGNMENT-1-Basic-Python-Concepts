# # Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# 
# ## Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 
# 
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# 
#    o	Addition
#    
#    o	Subtraction
# 
#    o	Multiplication
#    
#    o	Division
# 
# 
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
# 

# In[9]:


## Take the two numbers from the user 

a = int(input("Enter the first number :"))
b = int(input("Enter the second number :"))


## Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

##   o	Addition

##   o	Subtraction

##   o	Multiplication

##   o	Division


add = a + b 

sub = a - b 

mul = a * b 

div = a / b 



## Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

print("Addition is :", add)

print("Substraction is :", sub)

print("Multiplication is :", mul)

print("Division is :", div)
